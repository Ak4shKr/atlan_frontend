# SQL Query Runner Web App

This project is a web-based SQL query runner that allows users to execute SQL queries directly in the browser using **ALASQL.js**. It features query history management, state handling, and a user-friendly interface with support history storation.

## 🔥 Features

- **Execute SQL Queries**: Run `SELECT` queries in real-time.
- **Query History Management**: Automatically save and retrieve past queries.
- **Drawer Management**: Toggle between different sections smoothly and we have give a guidelines section to user can get familiar easily.
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimized performance with React Suspense & Lazy.
- **State Management with Localstorage**: Simplified History maintaining even u refresh page.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** - Frontend development
- **ALASQL.js** - In-browser SQL execution
- **Mantine UI** - UI components and styling
- **React Router** - Routing management
- **LocalStorage API** - Persistent query history
- **React Suspense & Lazy** - Lazy loading for optimized performance

## 🚀 Key Optimizations for 100% Performance

- **Code Splitting**: Components are dynamically loaded only when required.
- **Lazy Loading**: Routes and UI components are loaded asynchronously to reduce initial load time.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Heavy modules are imported on demand, reducing the JavaScript bundle size.
- **React Suspense**: Provides a smooth user experience by handling component loading states efficiently.
- **UseRef and UseMemo**: to reduce re-rendering.
